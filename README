# FoodNet
An e-food clone made for the course "Special Topics in Software Engineering" at uniWA.

### This project uses:
Node.js, Express.js, React, MySQL, Dapper, Tailwind CSS, .NET Core. 

### This project aims to:
- Host multiple stores, with multiple products.
- Host customers that make orders to those stores.
- Serve as a middleman for holding delivery orders for stores.
- Make seemless charges on each sale by increase orders to a point it's a mere negligible fee.

### Reproduction Steps (frontend)
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create files `frontend/server/.env` and `frontend/client/.env`, they **must** contain the following inside:

`frontend/client/.env`
```.env
REACT_APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
REACT_APP_PORT=<port from frontend/server/index.js:3>
REACT_APP_PROTOCOL=http/https
```

`frontend/server/.env`
```.env
API_IP=0.0.0.0
```

4. Run `npm i` at `frontend/client` and `frontend/server`.
5. Run `npm run build` at `frontend/client`, then using **serve** (npm i -g serve) `serve -s build`
6. Either run `node index.js` at `frontend/server`, or use **pm2** (npm i -g pm2) `pm2 start index.js --name server`. (any process manager will do for that matter)
